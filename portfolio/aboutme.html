<!-- 
	Welcome to what has hopefully by now become my portfolio website.
	Including sections for both WEB 110 and WEB 114.  Now, now don't fight
	there's enough internet for everyone. Seriously though thank both of 
	you for some great instruction this semester.  It's been an exceptionally
	stupid year for all of us, and I'm glad to see the end of it, but I've
	learned alot from both of your classes, so THANK YOU!

            I've studied computer programming in one form or another
            since the fourth grade. I studied it on and off throughout
            my K-12 years. When I went off to the University of Missouri-Columbia
            in 1999, I went for a bachelor's in computer science. I ended up
            graduating with...a B.A. in Technical Theatre!?! I know, how did
            that happen? That's a story for another time, suffice it to say,
            it did happen, and I've spent my time since them working all over
            the country, with many different acts, at many different theaters.
            From the Santa Fe Opera, to the Alley Theatre in Houston, I ended up
            settling in Las Vegas. While here in Vegas I've worked for The Blue Man Group
            Cirque du Soliel and a few others in between. It's been pretty wild.

            Well, that brings up to March 2020. I was at work, getting ready for
            another night in the Automation department at K; by Cirque du Soliel, when
            you guessed it, 2020 happened. Every show and casino on the strip, shuttered
            their doors and turned off the lights. We were the first ones to go, and if
            there are any shows still financially stable enough to reopen, we'll be the
            last ones to return.
