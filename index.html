<!-- 
	Welcome to what has hopefully by now become my portfolio website.
	Including sections for both WEB 110 and WEB 114.  Now, now don't fight
	there's enough internet for everyone. Seriously though thank both of 
	you for some great instruction this semester.  It's been an exceptionally
	stupid year for all of us, and I'm glad to see the end of it, but I've
	learned alot from both of your classes, so THANK YOU!

						<h2>Welcome.</h2>
						<p id="welcomeP">
							Hello there. My name is Matt Heapes, and I am a software 
							and web developer. I have experience programming back to 
							Apple BASIC on a Apple 2e, but more recently I've been learning Java, 
							C#, html5, css, and javaScript. That's all sort of new 
							though...sort of.<!-- &nbsp;<span id="ReadMore"><a href="aboutme.html">Read More</a></span> -->
						</p>
						<p id="p2">
							I've studied computer programming in one form or another
							since the fourth grade. I studied it on and off throughout
							my K-12 years. When I went off to the University of Missouri-Columbia
							in 1999, I went for a bachelor's in computer science. I ended up
							graduating with...a B.A. in Technical Theatre!?! I know, how did
							that happen? That's a story for another time, suffice it to say,
							it did happen, and I've spent my time since then working all over
							the country, with many different shows, at many different theaters.
							From the Santa Fe Opera, to the Alley Theatre in Houston, I ended up
							settling in Las Vegas. While here in Vegas I've worked for Blue Man Group,
							Cirque du Soliel and a few others in between. It's been pretty wild.
						</p>
						<p id="p3">
							Well, that brings up to March 2020. I was at work, getting ready for
							another night in the Automation department at KA by Cirque du Soliel, when
							you guessed it, 2020 happened. Every show and casino on the strip, shuttered
							their doors and turned off the lights. We were the amoung the first buisnesses
							to close, and if there are any shows still financially stable enough to reopen,
							we will be the last ones to reopen. So we hold together in our tight knit
							litte communities, each show it's own little suburb of the much larger city
							of our craft. Each city a part of the hidden world that helps to preserve the
							art that came before us and create new art all our own. In that preservation
							and creation we hope to inspire, to educate and to entertain.
